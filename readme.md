Project Fortress is a multi-purpose Discord bot, made from the leftovers of the deprecated Kylebot project. I personally haven't decided a name and theme for it but we will see how that will go. Confirmed features are game stats tracker supporting Call of Duty™️: Modern Warfare™️, Call of Duty™️: Black Ops™️ Cold War, Battlefield™️ 3, Battlefield™️ 4, Battlefield™️ Hardline, and Battlefield™️ V. BFV is bit harder tho, you have to request access to the TRN API.

## Bug Reports and Feature Request
Bugs reports or feature request should be made by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/Nefomemes/Kylebot/issues/new). Just, please make sure noone have posted it first.
 
## Non-Profit
This project is completely non-profit for the time being. I have not planned any monetization way for the bot.

## Legal Mumbo Jumbo
