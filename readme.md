# Kyle "Gaz" Garrick 
Welcome to the Kylebot repository, this the first Call of Duty-themed roleplay Discord bot. Well not much rp since most features will be locked with economy so that, people don't spam it, especially the spammy Tactical Nuke command, which doesn't exist yet but will.    

## Using the bot  
Before the bot can even exists on your server. You need to invite it. [Click here to invite the bot.](https://web.nefomemes.repl.co/kylebot/invite)   

**Note:** For the time being you can't currently invite the bot. This is because the bot is still in early alpha stage.    

Then, you can set the permissions. Administrator is ok and will enable every command, and making sure no errors caused by missing any permissions. However, it's not much great since your server can get nuked if the bot got hacked, error'd, etc. It's recommended to keep the default permissions.    

The prefix of the bot is `mw!` which is for the time being,it is guaranteed no bot have used it.    

And you can basically go to `mw!help` to get the full list of commands.    

You will doesn't need to actually create or setup your profile so that.        

Funfact: I used `will` because database connection have not been connection yet.

## Developer Guide
If you are looking at this repository to learn more about Discord bot development. Just keep in mind that all files in the `deprecated` folder are old codes that were removed from the bot and haven't been set up so that it works with the current command handler. Might have to delete that folder though.

## Frequently Asked Questions

##### The bot is down randomly. 
Yeh. The bot is still in early alpha stage. Which means that the bot will down so that the new things can load out, sorry.    

##### Where is the economy command (and any other commands)
Not yet until I have established MongoDB Atlas connection. If it doesn't connected to database. Just wait until I got to it, ok. If it doesn't have any relation to the database, it is because of the command handler rewrite.    

##### The bot's filter is wayyy worse than any other bots (which means a lot of my messages got deleted)  
That's your problem. Not mine. When the settings feature coming in. You will soon be able to set if you want the filter to be turned on and off. Only works for server admins / owner and no "except user / channel / role" thing because it is still a bad thing, no matter what skin you have, how much you have eaten today, or whatever. It wont be a much problem for now because there are no "warn" feature yet.
