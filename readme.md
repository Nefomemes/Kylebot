__**Hey there!**__  
Welcome to the Kylebot source code, the first Call of Duty-themed roleplay Discord bot, not much rp but it will got economy which is just to prevent abuse of some rp-dedicated killstreaks, like `nuke`. And for some reasons I have nothing to talk here lol. Anyways, we should do the FAQ here, shall we?       

**The bot is down randomly.**  
And yeah. The bot is still in early alpha stage. Which means that the bot will down so that the new things can load out, sorry.    

**Where is the economy command (and any other commands)**  
Not yet until I have established MongoDB Atlas connection. If it doesn't connected to database. Just wait until I got to it, ok.    

**How can I invite the bot?**

**I can't invite the bot.**    
The bot is still in early alpha stage. The bot is still private until we can set up things, like settings, etc etc.    

**The bot's filter is wayyy worse than any other bots (which means a lot of my messages got deleted)**  
That's your problem. Not mine. When the settings feature coming in. You will soon be able to set if you want the filter to be turned on and off. Only works for server admins / owner and no `except user / channel / role` thing. It wont be a much problem for now because there are no `warn` command yet.   

**How to support the bot?**
