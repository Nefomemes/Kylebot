# Frequently Asked Questions

## My message got filtered although I doesn't write anything related to the badwords issued.

<p> If some of your words contains the badwords issued, for example, "masuk" have the Javanese of "dog" inside of it, it will detected as a badword. This method is effective againts some bypass, although some innocent words will also get filtered. This is why we also put some words into the 'prio' list, so if the badword is in the 'prio' list, it will check first if the badword is the whole word or not.</p>
